# Project 3 - BGP Router


## Approach

We generally followed the suggested approach for this assignment, implementing each feature that was necessary to pass the test levels in order from 1 to 6. A lot of our problem solving and figuring out what to do came from looking at and running the test cases to figure out the expected behavior from the results. 
 

## Challenges

Our biggest challenge with this project was figuring out all of the criteria and necessary behavior of the router. While the instructions covered a large portion of what we needed to know, there was definitely quite a lot of expected behavior that had to be figured out/reverse-engineered from the test results. 

## Testing

We tested the project using the tests that were provided to us. In order to find the issues specifically related to our code we had the router print out values throughout the tests. But, for the most part, we just looked at the output of the given tests.
